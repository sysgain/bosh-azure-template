Solution Template Overview
Solution Templates provide customers with a highly automated process to launch enterprise ready first and 3rd party ISV solution stacks on Azure in a pre-production environment. The Solution Template effort is complimentary to the Azure Marketplace test drive program. These fully baked stacks enable customers to quickly stand up a PoC or Piloting environments and also integrate it with their systems and customization.
Customers benefit greatly from solution templates because of the ease with which they can stand up enterprise-grade, fully integrated stacks on Azure. The extensive automation and testing of these solutions will allow them to spin up pre-production environments with minimal manual steps and customization. Most importantly, customers now have the confidence to transition the solution into a fully production-ready environment with confidence.
Pivotal/Apigee/Concourse - Solution Template (TBD) launches a stack based around Pivotal Cloud Foundry, the leading cloud application platform for running Java microservices. This solution template will stand up a fully integrated PivotalCF stack along with Jenkins, Mongo and other services to rapidly build and deploy Java-based applications & microservices.
These are intended as pilot solutions and not production ready.
